# Snake Game

A simple snake game.

## About

Simple Javascript game. First Javascript (mini) project of me. 

Project implementation roadmap:

1. Build a basic user interface and game logic
2. Complete additional features: start screen, return to start interface when the snake dies, etc
3. Improve the graphics/user interface of the game
4. Additional features may be developed in the future or bugs that arise may be fixed. (optional)
